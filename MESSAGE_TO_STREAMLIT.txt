Subject: ModuleNotFoundError: Need Full Error Logs and Build Details

Hello Streamlit Support Team,

I'm experiencing a ModuleNotFoundError for the apify_client package in my Streamlit Cloud app, but the error message shown in the app is redacted. I need access to the full, unredacted error logs to debug this issue.

App Details:
- Repository: [FILL IN: Your GitHub repo URL]
- Branch: [FILL IN: Your branch name, e.g., main]
- App URL: [FILL IN: Your share.streamlit.io app URL]

Issue:
- Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'apify_client'
- Location: app.py, line 4: from apify_client import ApifyClient
- The error message shown in the app is redacted, preventing me from seeing the full traceback

What I've Verified:
- ✅ requirements.txt includes apify-client>=1.8.1 (package name with dash is correct)
- ✅ File is at the repository root
- ✅ File is committed and pushed to the branch
- ✅ Import statement uses apify_client (underscore) which matches the package

Build Logs Show:
- Using uv pip install
- Python 3.13.9 environment at /home/adminuser/venv
- "Resolved 54 packages" message appears
- Dependencies were processed successfully

What I Need:
1. Full build logs showing:
   - Whether apify-client was actually installed
   - Any errors during package installation
   - Complete pip install or uv pip install output

2. Full runtime error logs showing:
   - Complete Python traceback (not redacted)
   - Python path being used at runtime
   - sys.path at the time of the error
   - Whether the package appears in the installed packages list

3. Environment details:
   - Exact Python version used at runtime (logs show 3.13.9, but runtime.txt specifies 3.12)
   - Virtual environment path
   - Whether packages are installed in the correct environment

Questions:
1. How can I access the full, unredacted error logs?
2. Is there a way to see the complete build logs, especially the package installation step?
3. Could there be an environment mismatch (Python 3.13.9 vs runtime.txt specifying 3.12)?
4. Is apify-client being installed correctly, and if so, why can't it be imported?

Additional Context:
- The app works locally when I install dependencies manually
- The requirements.txt file format has been verified (no hidden characters, correct encoding)
- I've tried redeploying/rebooting the app multiple times

Thank you for your assistance!
